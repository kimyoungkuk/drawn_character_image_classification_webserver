# drawn_character_image_classification_webserver

##### It is drawn character iamge(like pikachu) classification webserver using deep learning.
##### We make model using pytorch, and used google icrawler and opencv for data preprocessing.

##### But, there is no model. ( Github allows only under 100MB files.)
##### So you should make model using pytorch or contact us directly.

##### If you make or get some model, you just put your model to "ti/static/ti" folder.
##### Your model's name should be "character_50.pth" or you should adjust "ti/veiws.py" file.

# drawn_character_image_classification_webserver

##### It is drawn character iamge(like pikachu) classification webserver using deep learning 
##### We make model using pytorch, and used google icrawler and opencv for data preprocessing

##### But, there is no model ( github allows only under 100MB files)
##### so you should make model using pytorch or contact us directly

##### If you make or get some model, you just put your model to ti/static/ti folder.
##### your model's name should be "character_50.pth" or you adjust "ti/veiws.py" file
